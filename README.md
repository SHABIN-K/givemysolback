# 💸 GiveMySolBack

**GiveMySolBack** is a full-stack Solana tool designed to help users reclaim SOL locked in unused or empty token accounts.

On the Solana network, inactive or zero-balance token accounts still consume rent. This app identifies such accounts and helps users safely close them — freeing up SOL and improving wallet hygiene.
